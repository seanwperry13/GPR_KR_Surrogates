**********************************************
The Kot-Schaffer equation is an integrodifference equation used in creating discrete-time growth-dispersal models in Ecology. 
More information on the equations themselves can be found in the following paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/0025-5564(86)90069-6

The code in this file was created by Dr. William Kalies to generate time series based on the Kot Schaffer equations.

The script KSR_iteration.m may be run first to generate the arrays P and Q. 

The sample data sets PKSlong and QKSlong were created with N=1000000 taking the first two columns of P and Q.
